1🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression — Short Summary
House Price Prediction using Linear Regression is a machine learning approach where we predict the price of a house based on features such as area, number of bedrooms, location, age of the house, and amenities.
Linear Regression works by finding a best-fit straight line that models the relationship between input features (independent variables) and house price (dependent variable). The model learns coefficients from historical data and uses them to estimate prices for new houses.
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics like R² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE). Due to its simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency, Linear Regression is widely used as a baseline model for real-estate price prediction projects.
✅ Best suited for understanding price trends and feature impact.
